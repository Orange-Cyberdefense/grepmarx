- BUG: Scan launch crash when a rule in the DB has no corresponding file

- BUG: Crash when regitering a new vuln with multiple OWASP ids (reproduce: scan DVPWA with python rule md5-used-as-password)

- IMPROVEMENT: Change vulnerability object structure - description => occurence.message, multiple owasp ids, multiple refs, multiple cwe, add technology

- IMPROVEMENT: Change supportedlanguage object structure - extensions as a list

- IMPROVEMENT: Default order is inconsistent on the project list page

- IMPROVEMENT: Dependencycheck integration

- IMPROVEMENT: Admin page to configure supported languages and extensions (for extensions remove last comma ',' if not needed!)

- IMPROVEMENT: Scan progress percentage (by calling semgrep file by file)

- IMPROVEMENT: Add ability to download semgrep JSON output

- IMPROVEMENT: Migrate to WTForms 3.x

- IMPROVEMENT: Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite in docker-compose configuration

- IMPROVEMENT: Auto select rule packs on the new scan launch screen depending on detected languages

- IMPROVEMENT: Better risk level calculation

- IMPROVEMENT: Display data flow in the workbench

- IMPROVEMENT: Replace pygments usage by simple extension-based recognition

- IMPROVEMENT: Fix the different security flaws ( Potential : Zip sleeping, SSTI, Path Traversal, RFI )
